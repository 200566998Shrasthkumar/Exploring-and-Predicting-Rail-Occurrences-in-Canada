The most common activities linked to occurrences involve the 'Proceeding' action, suggesting that crew oversight during train movements is a major risk factor. Training programs and operational safety checks for train crews should be prioritized to reduce these human-related risks."}]}

This suggests that existing regulations may need to be more strictly enforced or updated to address emerging risks, such as the increasing frequency of unauthorized train movements. Regular evaluations and updates to safety protocols, along with better compliance monitoring, could improve the effectiveness of current regulations."}]}
