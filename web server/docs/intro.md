## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing rail occurrences in Canada and building predictive models to forecast potential incidents. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance safety and provide valuable insights into railway operations.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing rail occurrence data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast future rail incidents.
- **Visualization**: Generating insightful charts and reports.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with various metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises historical rail occurrence records from Canada, including:
- Date and time of incidents
- Location details
- Type and severity of occurrences
- Weather conditions 
- Other contributing factors

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data analysis and modeling
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis

## Results & Findings

Key insights discovered during the project:
- Certain locations and times have a higher frequency of rail incidents.
- Weather conditions play a role in accident occurrence rates.
- Predictive models show promising accuracy in forecasting incidents.
