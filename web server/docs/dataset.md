# Dataset Overview

The dataset available at [TSB Rail Data](https://tsb.gc.ca/eng/stats/rail/data-5.html) is provided by the **Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB)**. It includes data on reportable rail accidents and incidents (collectively referred to as occurrences) from January 1983 onward. The TSB collects this information to analyze safety deficiencies and identify risks within the Canadian transportation system.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset is structured into multiple tables, each focusing on different aspects of rail occurrences:

### 1. Occurrence Data
- **Occurrence Summary**: Brief description of the occurrence.
- **Notification Details**: Date and time the occurrence was reported.

### 2. Track Infrastructure Data
- **Track Details**: Type of track, track owner, inspection history.
- **Rail Information**: Rail type, metallurgy, manufacturer, installation date, wear, and defects.
- **Tie Plates and Turnout Data**: Tie plate type, track fastener type, tie size, number of ties, turnout/switch type, installation date.
- **Track Geometry**: Curvature, gradient, ballast type, subgrade type, shoulder width, track structure type.

### 3. Environmental Conditions Data
- **Weather and Visibility**: Temperature, wind conditions, precipitation, sky conditions, visibility obstructions, ground conditions.

### 4. Area Evacuation Data
- **Evacuation Details**: Number of people evacuated, initiator of evacuation, involved agencies, isolation radius, emergency response information.

### 5. Crossing Accident Data
- **Crossing Characteristics**: Location, type of crossing, impact type, daily train/vehicle traffic, angle and gradient of crossing, sightline information, road speed, additional protections (e.g., whistling, flagman).
- **Grade Crossing Warning System (GCWS)**: Status, special features, design speed, test dates.
- **Vehicle Information**: Number and actions of vehicles, driver behavior, number of occupants, driver’s visibility at the crossing, any dangerous goods carried.

### 6. Train Data
- **Train Characteristics**: Type, operator, speed, control methods, number of cars, train length, weight.
- **Operation Details**: Authorized speed, signal indications, main track authorization methods, movement control types, event recorder indicators, crew assignment origins/destinations.
- **Signal Information**: Signal numbers, types, applications, wayside device details.

### 7. Rolling Stock Data
- **Rolling Stock Details**: Type, position in train, derailment indicators, load status, dangerous goods indicators, fuel loss from locomotives.
- **Component Specifics**: Sill, brake beam, handbrake, draft gear types, axle sizes, wheel types, car inspection details.
- **Cargo Information**: Product names, quantities carried, released products and their locations, release types, release quantities, tank car test dates.

## Data Dictionary

A comprehensive **data dictionary** detailing the fields within the dataset is available in **CSV format**. This dictionary provides descriptions and formats for each data field, facilitating a better understanding of the dataset’s structure and contents.
